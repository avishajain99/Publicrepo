## Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Cleaning, Data Formatting and Data Transformation in Excel
- Creating Tables in pgadmin to import the prepared data
- Casting and Converting Data Types
- Use of JOINS, Aggregate and Window Functions
- Creating CTE's abd Temp Tables
- Creating views to store data for visualizations later

## Project Guidance

This project is completed with the help of [Alex Freberg](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)'s SQL Project YouTube Tutorial. I am grateful for his incredible mentorship and guidance throughout the project.


## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating two "Comma-Separated files" namely Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations having relevant and cleaned datasets. After this we import the data into "pgadmin" and start getting to explore the data.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors.
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

## Key Insights 📈

   a) Cyprus- 72.81%
   
   b) San Marino- 70.23%
   
   c) Austria - 66.90% 
   
📌 Europe was the hardest hit being the only continent with over 2 million recorded deaths.
   
📌 Five countries with the highest death counts per population are: USA, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico

📌 Four countries with their maximum percentage of the population who are fully vaccinated until March 2023: Macau, Brunei, U.A.E., Qatar
