## Key Insights 📈

👉 Among the total 1470 employees, 237 (16.12%) of them are churned.

👉 The highest employee attrition occurs in the age groups of 18-30 and 30-40. This may suggest potential issues related to job satisfaction, career development, or workplace culture within these demographics, requiring attention and intervention to retain talent and maintain workforce stability.

👉 A higher attrition rate among employees who frequently engage in business travel compared to those who don't travel or travel rarely. Possible contributing factors may include the stress and disruptions associated with frequent travel, necessitating a review of travel policies and employee support to enhance retention.

👉 Research & Development and Sales department have higher employees attrition than HR department. Addressing potential factors such as intense competition in R&D, target-driven pressure in Sales, and distinct job satisfaction levels, is important for longer retention of employees.

👉 Employees churn rate is consistently declining with the increase of percentage hike in salary, suggests that salary dissatisfaction may be a key driver of attrition. Employees may seek better compensation elsewhere, emphasizing the need to align salary structures with market standards to improve retention.

👉 Male employees churned more compared to females. This observation requires a closer examination of factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction, career progression, or workplace policies, to implement targeted retention strategies and maintain a balanced workforce.

## 🚀 Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis conducted through Power BI offers valuable insights into various facets of employee attrition. These findings shed light on potential correlations between salary levels, age groups, and attrition rates within the organization, necessitating a closer examination to discern underlying reasons and develop targeted retention strategies.
