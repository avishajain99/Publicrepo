## Project Guidance

This project is completed with the help of [Alex Freberg](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)'s SQL Project YouTube Tutorial. I am grateful for his incredible mentorship and guidance throughout the project.


## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with creating two "Comma-Separated files" namely Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations having relevant and cleaned datasets. After this we import the data into "pgadmin" and start getting to explore the data.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors.
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
